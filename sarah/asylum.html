<center><u><b>Asylum | Asile | Ngunda</b></u></center><br><br><br>

Father and mother said if they ask you about our country make sure you draw disfigured faces. Sad faces, remember, you are sad; there is no peace at home. So at the centre we practiced. Father brought out blank paper and summoned us one by one. “A month from now we are going to the tribunal and the judge will hear our case; do not be the weak link in the chain!” <br><br>

Back then there was only four of us: Émile, Sophie, Dieu-Merci, and me. Our mother was a housewife and our father was tired: I’m not too sure what Father did for a living, but he always said he was tired. We arrived at the centre two weeks ago, I’m not sure what this place is called, but everyone is mostly Black or some kind of brown. Back in my old home my neighbours were white (Mother says I’m not allowed to say things like this anymore). It’s super loud here too, and the women smell like perfume, armpits and bleaching cream. The men dress flashy to go out on weekends to drink beer and chase white women, but are in bed all the rest of the week—too tired to clean the communal bathrooms; or in prayer; always in prayer for papers. This is life in the centre. Yesterday, two women were fighting because one accused the other of taking her gold bracelet. Later that night, when a bystander who had seen the apparent theft asked the accused where she got the bracelet, all she could do was point at the bracelet and say, “Kosovo, Kosovo!” <br><br>

Yet, everyone behaves on Mondays. Monday is when the caseworkers, social workers, translators, psychologists, and advocates come; everyone behaves. On Mondays—when the caseworkers, social workers, translators, psychologists, and advocates come—everyone speaks in indoor voices, only the infants are loud. The women still smell like perfume, armpits, and bleaching cream, but wear wrappers and head ties to communicate their poverty to the whites. The men (now pious) dress modestly—like Canadians—“everyday big coats, boots, and jeans—absolutely, no fashion”. Mondays are also when the children are taken to see the psychologists for evaluation. Since we just arrived, my siblings and I don’t have to go yet. However, at home, Father makes sure we practice.<br><br>


<br><center><u>Practice</u></center><br><br>
Émile drew a lot of scribbles on his paper; nothing ever made sense. I once overheard Mother tell someone that Émile had trouble following instructions because he had a lot of blows, I didn’t know what this meant except maybe that he had a big head. Nonetheless, I kept this observation to myself. Father didn’t understand Émile’s drawings either, everytime he asked,  "where are the severed heads?" 
Mama always intervene on Émile’s behalf (he was her oldest and the most troubled, for this, she had endless understanding for her enfant chéri). <br><br>
"Papa", she would say, "Why do you press Émile so hard, let him. This is perfect." 
Mama would hail Émile’s art as the pictorial psychology of a traumatized  child (she was always talking about other people being traumatized), and everytime Father would forget her analysis of Émile’s drawings. Maybe Father had many blows too—he also had a big head. Anyhow, Émile was always dismissed after, and allowed to return to his gameboy until the next day, when practice resumed. Sophie's turn were always time consuming; you see, Father insisted we were not to draw at the same time, “to curb the spirit of cheating”, he said—and just like her delicate little name—all her ways argued for perfection. She carried an air of coy peculiarity that unnerved me, no one said it, but Sophie was a prissy. I hated Sophie's turn. Father complained that her pictures were way too small for tired adult eyes to see. Father would then tell Sophie to make it bigger, and she would promise to “try”. Sophie's second draft was always what Father wanted. I suspected she only did it for the pat she received on top of her head, and the way Father would lift her paper and say, "AHHH!"<br><br>
Sophie loved to dance for Papa.<br><br>


<br><center><u>Asylum Isn’t for Mental Babies</u></center><br><br>
Dieu-Merci's turn always came with questions: why must we draw dead people, but we are not allowed to watch Dragon Ball Z because of the violence? Do white people not know when Africans are lying? I have never even seen Mobutu... Jeanne have you? <br><br>
I always replied the same, “we must do as Father says if we want papers”. You see, white people have certain ways in which they do things in their country. We are too little to understand, but Father knows them—Father knows everything. Last night I discovered something, there’s a secret list that the adults always read from— I think it’s called “Asylum Isn’t For”—One day I was listening to Father speaking to his friend Parisien (whose name is Zino Bwakende to the caseworkers or Tala Miso to the all the women here) about asylum. I think Father was angry because he started rambling all these things from Asylum Isn’t For. Anyway, I’ve never seen the list but I remember bits, and from I’ve heard, <br><br>

asylum isn’t for: mental babies and scaredy-cats, sheep or goats, and people who are stickler for rules; people who live and die with the same first name; the faint-hearted, monolinguals, or people who can’t signal with their eyes. It definitely isn’t for people who lack the ability to point with their lips; or recognize that an elbow pinch means stop. Asylum isn’t for people who aren’t quick to call white people: stupid, racist, and naive in secret; and intelligent, principled, and clever, in  public.<br><br>

That’s what Father, and the other people we met at the centre, say. I asked Father about the list once, he looked confused, then he got angry. He told me all I need to know is this: asylum isn’t for children with big mouths, and tongues set ablaze with curious questions. Later that night I asked Dieu-Merci about asylum—he was older and therefore wiser. He told me: <br><br>

asylum, was for the seasoned wanderers, the slick talkers; the ones who could summon fake tears, to bring out real tears in white advocates. Asylum was for battered women (but not by their husbands!); political shit disturbers and failed opposition leaders; and for people who lost limbs to what they claimed was witchcraft back home, but now is neuroma. But most importantly, asylum is for children who obey their parents and nod when called by forged names. You see, the process of immigration is a game, but not for babies.<br><br>

 I asked Dieu-Merci where he heard that, he said it was from The List.  <br><br>


<br><center><u>What God Said</center></u><br><br>
Dieu-Merci’s “is eleven and justified in his ways, and so he carried on” is what Father said one day. All I know is both him and Father argued a lot. He always started his sentence with “I think” and not with “Papa do you think...”<br><br>
 	The scene was always the same—Father loved repetition and everything was practice. So he would ask Sophie to bring his bible. Sophie never missed a beat, she skipped with the wanton joy of what would happen next. When Sophie handed Father the bible he would ask us to gather around close; as disciplines we drew closer.<br><br>
"What is this?" Father barked.<br>
“A bible”, we answered. <br><br>
Father gave a slow nod and then turned specifically to Dieu-Merci, "now you, What is this?" Dieu-Merci’s character was one of an intellectual Mother often said. I wasn't sure what it meant, except it got him in trouble a lot. I always watched Dieu-Merci's answers to see if I could figure out what Mother meant when she said “intellectual”. 
Today he answered with an even voice, "this is the word of God Papa."<br><br>
Father was calm, nothing ever hinted at the complete madness that followed.
"My son" he said as he handed the bible, with the torn binding and coloured sticky notes to Dieu-Merci, "read exodus 20:12".<br><br>
Whenever we read the bible with the chaplain at the centre he told us “God is love”. He said baby Jesus was a refugee and God has a plan for all the children in Africa. He taught us the words to Gospel Kids, and when we were sad he would sing “Come and go with me, to my Father's house.” He never spoke of papers, or drawings, or obedience. Home was different. <br><br>

In times like this Dieu-Merci always did as he was told. When he read the verse Father nodded then beckoned him closer. I’m almost certain that in their proximity, Dieu-Merci could surely taste the mixture of halitosis, and the lamb stew that thinly coated the back of Father’s tongue—waiting to be washed away by his hydrogen peroxide mouth rinse or Pepsi-Cola—whichever came first—something the rest of us could only smell, but pretended to politely ignore.<br><br>
 
“Now son, every week you do this, I'm convinced you do not wish to obey me. The word of God recommends, I must take action to correct your path”. <br><br>
Father ordered Sophie to get the belt tucked in the bottom drawer of the vanity in my parent’s room. Sophie never refused to be used by Father. The beatings were always mechanical, they followed the meter set by Father’s anger. Dieu-Merci received ten lashes, I winced as Father counted to keep tempo. In these moments I always looked around to see that I wasn’t alone in my discomfort: Mother always pretended nothing was wrong, and if there was, she barely voiced it. When it came to Father’s anger against us kids, she often just whispered. Émile usually looked down, perhaps, he knew that the distance between being an observer and a victim of the belt was incredibly small. I never blamed him, he was troubled and for some reasons he was always next. But Sophie, she always smiled as if morbidly fascinated by the spectacle before her.<br><br>




<u><center>Practice</u></center><br><br>
I was next to practice. I didn’t know what to make of all this, or why we were sometimes beat to draw; all I knew was I really didn’t want to be an intellectual. If we wanted papers we must do as Father said, but the more I started thinking about all of this, the more I had questions. I wanted to know what asylum really meant, or why the old countries wouldn’t take us anymore. I wanted to know why in this place, different families were coming or going as revolving doors. I wanted to know why everyone yelled; why that woman always yelled Kosovo. Also why were there were no true white people living here. I wanted to know why Father was always tired, but not tired enough to be angry at us. I wanted to know how long we would stay here, and why everyone prayed for papers when there were so many scattered with red scribbles in the REC room. But I suppose it was best to observe, I was learning so much by just watching.<br><br>

When Father finally called for my paper, I wondered if he’d be confused by my drawing, like Dieu-Merci said, none of us have seen Mobutu…
